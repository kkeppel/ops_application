I. INTRODUCTION & SERVICE TERMS<br><br></div>
<div id ="right"> </div>
<div id="left">
Cater2.me (“Cater2.me,” “we,” or “us”) connects providers of catering (hereinafter referred to as “Providers” or “Vendors”) to buyers of catering (hereinafter referred to as “Buyers”). Please read this Terms and Conditions of Service Agreement ("Provider Agreement") in its entirety.<br><br>
</div>
<div id ="right">We’re Cater2.me. You’re the Provider. </div>

<div id="left">
1. Cater2.me Fees and payment collection <br></div>
<div id="left">Any order placed through the Cater2.me system on your behalf will be subject to the Cater2.me fee. The Cater2.me fee schedule will be agreed upon between the Provider and a Cater2.me sales representative and will be documented by email, fax, or explicit agreement in an online form. The Cater2.me fee is charged as a percentage of the Total Retail Price of an order, which is the pre-tax total amount of the order. The pre-tax total amount includes the cost of all food, delivery charges, service charge, serving ware charges, etc. Sales tax and client designated tips will be exempt from the Cater2.me fee. The Cater2.me fee schedules are based on the headcount for each order. The headcount for each order is designated by the Client. Clients may update headcounts between initial order confirmation and actual order execution. The headcount for purposes of the calculation of the Cater2.me fee is the headcount last confirmed by Cater2.me prior to event completion or with explicit notice following event completion. <br><br></div>
<div id ="right">Cater2.me charges a fee on orders placed on the Provider’s behalf through our system. We’ll document those fees separately. Those fees will be charged on the pre-tax total of each order. </div>
<div id="left">

Payment will be carried out between the Client and Cater2.me. Unless explicitly agreed upon in writing, the Provider should not accept payment for orders directly from Clients. Cater2.me will pass on payment to Providers in accordance with the Invoicing and Payment Schedule terms [See Invoicing and Payment Schedule]. For each Order, the Provider will receive the amount equal to the Total Retail Price plus any Client-designated tips, less the Provider portion of applicable credit card fees (credit card fee percentage on pre-tax total amount less Cater2.me fee, plus tax and tips), less any applicable Cater2.me Fees. <br><br></div>
<div id ="right">Clients pay Cater2.me directly and we then pay the Providers out. </div>
<div id="left">


Any changes to the Provider’s Fee Schedule will be communicated to Provider at least two (2) weeks prior to enacting the change. Any Orders approved before the change to the fee schedule will be subject to the old fee schedule. Any Proposals approved after the change to the fee schedule will be subject to the new fee schedule.<br><br>
</div><div id ="right">Cater2.me reserves the right to change the fees, but will give the Providers notice before doing so.</div>

<div id="left">
2. Order generation <br></div>
<div id="left">
Cater2.me will generate Orders on behalf of Providers based on Provider’s menu at time of Provider sign-up or Provider-specified updated menu. Cater2.me will make good faith efforts to place orders according to Provider capabilities. Provider authorizes menu for use on the system, designating all items to be included on the menu, individual prices and any delivery or Service Charges. It is the Provider’s responsibility to notify Cater2.me when menu items, prices, pricing methods, or charges have changed. Provider’s menu pricing must reflect the Provider’s publicly offered catering menu where available. <br><br></div>
<div id ="right">Cater2.me will create orders on the Provider’s behalf in good faith, utilizing current information about menu and capabilities that the Provider has provided. </div>

<div id="left">
3. Order confirmation<br></div>
<div id="left">
When Cater2.me has created an order, they will send an order confirmation email to the Provider. When the Provider confirms an order, the order confirmation is then a binding agreement to provide the menu exactly as enumerated on the form, at the designated time, date and location and for the proposed price. Any subsequent order updates sent to the Provider via email supersede the original order confirmation and do not need to be expressly confirmed by the Provider to be in force. Should a Provider deviate from the confirmed order details in any way, they may be subject to credits due to the Clients. If a Provider cannot execute an order for any reason, they must give explicit written notice to Cater2.me as soon as they are aware of the reason. Orders are assumed to be confirmed until otherwise communicated that they are not confirmed. 
<br><br></div>
<div id ="right">Cater2.me will confirm an order and send it to a Provider. Once confirmed, the Provider agree to do the order as designated. </div>
<div id="left">


4. ‘Day of’ order communication<br></div>
<div id="left">
Cater2.me requires verbal or written confirmation of an order on the day of the order. Cater2.me will attempt to contact the Provider by all available means. If Cater2.me cannot reach the Provider, we may cancel your order and book another Provider with no cancellation penalty due to the Provider. <br><br></div>
<div id ="right">Cater2.me will try to contact you on the day of an order. Confirm or we may have to cancel the order. </div>
<div id="left">

5. Order credits<br>
Should there be an issue with an order, Cater2.me will work with the Client and Provider to determine the appropriate credit due on the order. The credit amount will be confirmed in writing by Cater2.me with the Provider.

6. Order cancellation<br>
Buyers submit to the Order cancellation policy of the Provider. Should a Buyer need to cancel an Order, they will refer to the Provider’s cancellation policy. Should a Provider not have a cancellation policy, cancellation penalty will be assessed on a case by case basis.<br><br></div>
<div id="left">

7. Invoicing and payment schedule<br></div>
<div id="left">
Providers will be paid on a monthly cycle. All Orders from a calendar month will be aggregated and presented on a single invoice. Providers will be paid by the 15th day of the following month (e.g. all orders in January will be paid in one check by the 15th of February). <br><br></div>
<div id ="right">Cater2.me will pay the provider by the 15th of the month following an order. </div>
<div id="left">

8. Tips<br>
Buyers can designate tips in a number of ways. Once a tip has been designated, Cater2.me will record the tip amount and will communicate the tip amount on the monthly invoice and will pay out the entire tip amount. Buyers reserve the right to pay cash tips to delivery personnel at time of delivery.<br><br>

9. Credit card fees <br>
Orders for which Buyers pay with credit cards will be assessed a credit card processing fee. The credit card fee will be charged to the Providers on the Total Retail Price plus sales tax of the Order less the Cater2.me Fee. Fee amounts vary based on type of credit card used. Credit card fees will be enumerated per Order on monthly invoices on a per Order basis.<br><br>

10. Fee netting<br>
Any fees incurred by the Provider during a billing cycle (e.g. Order cancellation, credits) will be netted from the total payment made in that billing cycle. If the amount of the fees is greater than total payments in the current billing cycle, the amount will be owed by the Provider to Cater2.me.<br><br>
</div>

<div id="left">
11. Cancellation and modification of service<br></div>
<div id="left">
Participation in the Cater2.me service may be cancelled by both the Provider and Cater2.me at any time at either party’s discretion. Upon notice of cancellation, Cater2.me will stop booking orders. Providers agree to complete any orders previously confirmed. Any payments to Providers follow the same guidelines enumerated above in the Invoicing and payment schedule section.<br><br></div>
<div id ="right">Cater2.me can cancel service with a Provider. A Provider can cancel service with Cater2.me. If a Provider cancels, they agree to complete all confirmed future orders.</div>
<div id="left">


12. Sales Tax<br></div>
<div id="left">

For all Orders in which the Buyer pays Cater2.me, Cater2.me will collect the sales tax.
